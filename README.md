To-Do List App in Python
This project implements a simple to-do list application in Python.

Features:

Add new tasks.
View all existing tasks.
Mark tasks as done.
Exit the application.
Running the Script:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., todoList.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using the following command:
Bash
python todoList.py
Use code with caution.
Using the App:

The application will display a menu with four options:

Add Task: Enter a new task description to add it to the list.
View Tasks: View all tasks currently in the list.
Mark Task Done: Select a task by number to mark it as completed and remove it from the list.
Exit: Terminate the application.
Example Usage:

Choose option 1 to add a few tasks (e.g., "Buy groceries", "Finish report").
Select option 2 to view the list of tasks.
Choose option 3 and enter the number of a task to mark it done (e.g., select 1 to mark "Buy groceries" as done).
Use option 2 again to verify the completed task is removed from the list.
Finally, select option 4 to exit the application.
Enhancements:

This is a basic implementation. You can extend it with features like:

Due dates: Assign due dates to tasks for better organization.
Priorities: Prioritize tasks with labels (high, medium, low).
Persistence: Save tasks to a file to maintain them across application sessions.
GUI: Develop a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly experience (using libraries like Tkinter).
